# Network protocols

## What is protocol ?

In general protocol means a set of rules. Let's take one analogy to understand protocols.

Let say you you want to communicate some random person so there will be some set of rules like:

1. First you select a common language you both know.

2. Then you ask if he is comferatable in communication or not. This can be done with some gesturs like hand shaking.

3. Then you start communication.

4. The convey of message should be in sequence.

5. If person next to you didn't reply thats means he is not intrested in talking.

## what is network protocols?

A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message.

steps can be applied on communication happend in computer networks:-

1. First source and destination choose a language. It could be JSON, XML etc.

2. They check if they are confirtable in communication means both are up and runnig. This process in computer science called as handshaking.

3. After handshaking the actual data transfer will start. which is called as communication.

4. The information received by destination should be in sequence.

5. If destination system didn't reply than may be the message is lost somewhere is the possibility. But if destination system didn't reply after many tries that means destination system is down.

## Most common protocols?

1. IP (Internet protocol)

2. TCP

3. HTTP

* why we need sequence number.
* source address and destination address.
* port number
* IP header
* TCP header
* header
* data
* curl command
